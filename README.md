# MedSession

MedSession is an attempt to develop a ubiquitous platform for use by trained healthcare professionals. The main motivating idea behind MedSession is to target the development of platforms and devices for rural healthcare use. Rural healthcare is beset by several challenges some of which include lack of enough number of trained professionals and access to state of the art healthcare. Telemedicine can be pushed for healthcare in remote areas but it would depend on the availability of high bandwidth and better internet connectivity to provide for virtual visits by specialists.  A lack of healthcare professionals can inhibit access to services by limiting the supply of available services, a HSRA report states that about 60% of the healthcare professionals are present in urban and semi urban areas.
